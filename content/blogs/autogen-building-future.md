# AutoGen: Building the Future

## Text Wrapping Images

![Small floating left](/portfolio/blogs/autogen-building-future/gallery.png "{\"size\":\"small\",\"align\":\"left\",\"wrap\":true,\"caption\":\"Floating left\"}") 
This text will wrap around the image that's floating to the left. You can write multiple sentences here and they will flow naturally around the image. The image takes up space on the left side while the text flows on the right. This is great for creating magazine-style layouts where you want the text to flow around smaller images.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

![Small floating right](/portfolio/blogs/autogen-building-future/gallery.png "{\"size\":\"small\",\"align\":\"right\",\"wrap\":true,\"caption\":\"Floating right\"}") 
This text will wrap around the image that's floating to the right. The image appears on the right side while the text flows on the left. This creates a nice visual break in your content and allows for more compact layouts when you have smaller images.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

## Block Images (No Wrapping)

![Large block image](/portfolio/blogs/autogen-building-future/gallery.png "{\"size\":\"large\",\"caption\":\"This is a block image\"}")

This text appears below the image because it's not set to wrap.
